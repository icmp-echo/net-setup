# net-setup

This script will automate the configuration of netgear GS105poe in large network environment.

its design to save time and effort for large deployments.

Basically you connect GS105PE to any network out-of-box and let it pull IP >> that is gonna be your temp ip for first input.

Have other things ready like vlan info and hostname and what not.

run the script by "net-setup.sh" and follow prompts.

feel free to make change according to your need.
